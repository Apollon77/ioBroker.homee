**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to me as the developer.** More details see below!

## Description
This adapter connects ioBroker to homee and provides the following features:
* allows connection via IP or homee-ID and username/password
* read all devices(nodes) and states (attributes) and show their values including updates in ioBroker
* allow changing values in ioBroker and send them back to homee to control devices
* acts as a ioBroker History provider for all states devices where history is enabled in homee. This means you can use the history values stored in homee to display in ioBroker using flot, Admin or also JavaScript including all aggregations on data level as known from e.g. History adapter

not (yet) supported:
* groups, because they don't offer any functions like a group-level-state or real writing to all devices at once in homee
* heating-plans

This adapter is based on the outstanding work of [stfnhmplr](http://twitter.com/stfnhmplr) and his [homee-api](https://github.com/stfnhmplr/homee-api).


## Known issues
* On js-controller <1.5.0 it can have strange effects when enabling other history providers on some of the roles (e.g. "switch")

## How to report issues and feature requests

Please use GitHub issues for this.

Best is to set the adapter to Debug log mode (Instances -> Expert mode -> Column Log level). Then please get the logfile from disk (subdirectory "log" in ioBroker installation directory and not from Admin because Admin cuts the lines). If you do not like providing it in GitHub issue you can also send it to me via email (iobroker@fischer-ka.de). Please add a reference to the relevant GitHub issue AND also describe what I see in the log at which time.

## What is Sentry and what is reported to the servers?
Sentry.io is a way for developers to get an overview about errors from their applications. And exactly this is implemented in this adapter.

When the adapter crashes or an other Code error happens, this error message that also appears in the ioBroker log is submitted to our own Sentry server hosted in germany. When you allowed iobroker GmbH to collect diagnostic data then also your installation ID (this is just a unique ID **without** any additional infos about you, email, name or such) is included. This allows Sentry to group errors and show how many unique users are affected by such an error. All of this helps me to provide error free adapters that basically never crashs.
